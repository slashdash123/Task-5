# Task-5
Timers (simple weather station using temperature and humidity module AM2302 (DHT22))

IMPORTANT Some variable declarations and function names are in my native language (Slovene). Reason being is, I did these assignments in the scope of my University. Hopefully the code will make sense, as I briefly explain the purpose of each task below.

The task here was to implement a simple weather station using timers with temperature and humidity module AM2302. Results were printed using printf function.

Tools used: STM32F429I discovery board (Cortex M4), breadboard, wires, temperature and humidity module AM2302, cooling spray for testing
